# Character Foundry Notes

Notes on features that should be implemented at the `@character-foundry/*` level rather than in CardsHub.

## Currently Identified

*None yet - will add as discovered during v1.0/v1.1 work*

---

## Federation (v2.0)

When we reach federation work, these items belong in character-foundry:
- ActivityPub protocol implementation
- Card serialization for federation
- Instance identity/actor management
- Cross-instance card discovery protocol
